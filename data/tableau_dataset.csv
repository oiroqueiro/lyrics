(A tale as old as time) I wake up screaming from dreaming One day, I'll watch as you're leaving And life will lose all its meaning (For the last time)  It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime, everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero You might also like I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out ""She's laughing up at us from Hell""  It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi Everybody agrees, everybody agrees  It's me, hi (Hi) I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees) I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero Meet me at midnight  Staring at the ceiling with you Oh, you don't ever say too much And you don't really read into My melancholia  I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah) You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah) All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah) I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me Surreal I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say No deal The 1950s shit they want from me I just wanna stay in that lavender haze  All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me) Is if I'm gonna be your bride The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see) Is a one-night or a wife  I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah) They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah) But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)  I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me Surreal I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say No deal The 1950s shit they want from me I just wanna stay in that lavender haze You might also like That lavender haze  Talk your talk and go viral I just need this love spiral Get it off your chest Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk) Talk your talk and go viral I just need this love spiral Get it off your chest Get it off my desk  I feel (I feel), the lavender haze creeping up on me Surreal I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say No deal (No deal) The 1950s shit they want from me I just wanna stay in that lavender haze  Get it off your chest Get it off my desk That lavender haze I just wanna stay I just wanna stay in that lavender haze Rain He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain He wanted a bride, I was making my own name Chasing that fame, he stayed the same All of me changed like midnight  My town was a wasteland Full of cages, full of fences Pageant queens and big pretenders But for some, it was paradise My boy was a montage A slow-motion, love potion Jumping off things in the ocean I broke his heart 'cause he was nice He was sunshine, I was midnight rain He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain He wanted a bride, I was making my own name Chasing that fame, he stayed the same All of me changed like midnight  It came like a postcard Picture perfect shiny family Holiday peppermint candy But for him, it's every day So I peered through a window A deep portal, time travel All the love we unravel And the life I gave away 'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain  He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain He wanted a bride, I was making my own name Chasing that fame, he stayed the same All of me changed like midnight rain He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain He wanted a bride, I was making my own name Chasing that fame, he stayed the same All of me changed like midnight You might also like I guess sometimes we all get Just what we wanted, just what we wanted And he never thinks of me Except for when I'm on TV I guess sometimes we all get Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted And I never think of him Except on midnights like this (Midnights like this, midnights like this) When the morning came We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf 'Cause we lost track of time again Laughing with my feet in your lap Like you were my closest friend ""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say ""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"" I see you every day now  And I chose you The one I was dancing with In New York, no shoes Looked up at the sky and it was The burgundy on my t-shirt When you splashed your wine into me And how the blood rushed into my cheeks So scarlet, it was The mark thеy saw on my collarbone The rust that grew bеtween telephones The lips I used to call home So scarlet, it was maroon When the silence came We were shaking, blind and hazy How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
